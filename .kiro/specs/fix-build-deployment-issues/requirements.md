# Requirements Document - Fix Build and Deployment Issues

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical build and deployment issues preventing the SmartFinance application from running properly. The issues include TypeScript compilation errors in the frontend and Docker port conflicts that block the containerized deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Frontend TypeScript Build Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to build successfully without TypeScript errors, so that the application can be deployed and run properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN calling transactionService.getTransactions THEN the system SHALL provide all required TransactionFilter properties
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate production-ready assets
4. IF TypeScript strict mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL enforce all interface requirements

### Requirement 2: Resolve Docker Port Conflicts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start all Docker services without port conflicts, so that the full application stack can run locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting Docker services THEN the system SHALL not encounter port binding conflicts
2. WHEN Redis service starts THEN the system SHALL use an available port
3. WHEN all services are running THEN the system SHALL be accessible on the expected ports
4. IF a port is already in use THEN the system SHALL use alternative port mappings

### Requirement 3: Ensure Docker Environment Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker Desktop to connect properly, so that I can manage containers and services effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running docker-compose commands THEN the system SHALL connect to Docker daemon successfully
2. WHEN Docker Desktop is running THEN the system SHALL respond to Docker CLI commands
3. WHEN containers are stopped THEN the system SHALL clean up resources properly
4. IF Docker Desktop is not running THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Validate Service Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all microservices to communicate properly after deployment, so that the application functions as designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all services are running THEN the frontend SHALL connect to the backend API
2. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL connect to SQL Server and Redis
3. WHEN the payment service starts THEN the system SHALL connect to MongoDB and Redis
4. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL handle authentication and data flow correctly

### Requirement 5: Maintain Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and deployment process to be reliable, so that I can focus on feature development rather than infrastructure issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making code changes THEN the system SHALL rebuild and redeploy successfully
2. WHEN running the full stack THEN the system SHALL provide health checks for all services
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logs and error messages
4. IF services fail to start THEN the system SHALL provide actionable troubleshooting information
