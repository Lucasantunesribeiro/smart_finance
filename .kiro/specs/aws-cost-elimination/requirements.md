# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completely eliminating AWS costs for the Smart Finance application while maintaining full functionality through a strategic migration to free-tier only services and alternative deployment methods. The goal is to achieve zero monthly AWS billing while preserving all application capabilities including the .NET backend, Next.js frontend, payment microservice, and database functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to eliminate all AWS costs immediately, so that I can maintain the application without any monthly charges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cost elimination process is executed THEN all billable AWS services SHALL be terminated or migrated to free alternatives
2. WHEN the monthly billing cycle completes THEN the total AWS cost SHALL be $0.00
3. IF any service generates costs THEN the system SHALL automatically alert and provide termination options
4. WHEN cost monitoring is enabled THEN any usage approaching free tier limits SHALL trigger warnings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the Smart Finance application using only free AWS services, so that I can maintain full functionality without costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the backend THEN the system SHALL use only EC2 t2.micro instances within free tier limits
2. WHEN deploying the database THEN the system SHALL use either RDS free tier or containerized MongoDB on EC2
3. WHEN deploying static assets THEN the system SHALL use S3 free tier or GitHub Pages
4. WHEN configuring networking THEN the system SHALL use only free VPC and security group configurations
5. IF free tier limits are exceeded THEN the deployment SHALL fail with clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated monitoring and shutdown capabilities, so that costs never accumulate unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are created THEN automatic shutdown schedules SHALL be configured
2. WHEN free tier usage approaches 80% THEN alerts SHALL be sent immediately
3. WHEN any billable service is detected THEN automatic termination SHALL be triggered
4. WHEN monitoring detects anomalies THEN all non-essential services SHALL be stopped

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want alternative deployment options outside AWS, so that I have backup solutions if AWS free tier is insufficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS deployment fails THEN alternative platforms SHALL be available (Railway, Render, Vercel)
2. WHEN migrating to alternatives THEN all application data SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN using alternative platforms THEN the same functionality SHALL be maintained
4. IF alternative deployment is needed THEN migration SHALL complete within 30 minutes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation of the free deployment strategy, so that future deployments can be executed without generating costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include step-by-step cost elimination procedures
2. WHEN following the guide THEN any developer SHALL be able to deploy without AWS costs
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN clear solutions SHALL be provided for common cost-related problems
4. WHEN updating the deployment THEN cost impact SHALL be clearly documented for each change
