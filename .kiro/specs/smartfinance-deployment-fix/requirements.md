# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the complete deployment and CI/CD pipeline fixes for the SmartFinance application. The goal is to achieve a 100% functional, zero-cost deployment on AWS EC2 free tier while resolving all GitHub Actions failures and PowerShell script issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AWS CLI Installation and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AWS CLI properly installed and configured so that I can manage AWS resources programmatically and deploy to EC2 successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS CLI installation is initiated THEN the system SHALL install the latest AWS CLI version compatible with Windows
2. WHEN AWS CLI is configured THEN the system SHALL set up proper credentials and region configuration
3. WHEN AWS CLI commands are executed THEN the system SHALL return valid responses without authentication errors
4. IF AWS CLI is already installed THEN the system SHALL verify and update the configuration as needed

### Requirement 2: PowerShell Script Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all PowerShell deployment scripts to execute without errors so that I can deploy the application successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN execute-complete-solution.ps1 is run THEN the system SHALL complete without "Using variable" errors
2. WHEN any PowerShell script references variables THEN the system SHALL use proper PowerShell syntax
3. WHEN scripts execute AWS commands THEN the system SHALL handle authentication and region settings correctly
4. IF script errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery steps

### Requirement 3: GitHub CI/CD Pipeline Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all GitHub Actions workflows to pass successfully so that the application can be automatically tested and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN .NET Backend tests run THEN the system SHALL pass all unit and integration tests
2. WHEN Payment Microservice tests run THEN the system SHALL complete without failures
3. WHEN Security Scan executes THEN the system SHALL pass all security checks without vulnerabilities
4. WHEN Next.js Frontend tests run THEN the system SHALL continue to pass as currently working
5. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs for debugging

### Requirement 4: Zero-Cost EC2 Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SmartFinance application deployed on AWS EC2 free tier with zero monthly costs so that I can run the application without any billing charges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EC2 instance is launched THEN the system SHALL use only t2.micro instance type
2. WHEN resources are provisioned THEN the system SHALL stay within free tier limits (750 hours/month)
3. WHEN application is deployed THEN the system SHALL use only free-tier eligible services
4. WHEN cost monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL automatically shutdown if any costs are detected
5. IF free tier limits are approached THEN the system SHALL send alerts and take preventive actions

### Requirement 5: Complete Application Functionality

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the SmartFinance application to be fully functional with all services running so that I can use all features without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL have all microservices running and healthy
2. WHEN users access the frontend THEN the system SHALL serve the Next.js application correctly
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL respond from the .NET backend successfully
4. WHEN payment operations are performed THEN the system SHALL process through the payment microservice
5. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL persist information in MongoDB correctly
6. IF any service fails THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints and recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Infrastructure as Code Validation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all infrastructure configurations to be validated and working so that deployments are consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CloudFormation templates are deployed THEN the system SHALL create all resources successfully
2. WHEN Docker containers are built THEN the system SHALL complete without build errors
3. WHEN docker-compose configurations are used THEN the system SHALL start all services correctly
4. WHEN nginx configurations are applied THEN the system SHALL route traffic properly
5. IF infrastructure deployment fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to previous stable state

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting so that I can ensure the system stays within free tier limits and operates correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cost monitoring runs THEN the system SHALL check AWS billing every hour
2. WHEN resource usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL track EC2 hours and other free tier metrics
3. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL send notifications via email
4. WHEN emergency shutdown is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically terminate billable resources
5. IF monitoring fails THEN the system SHALL use failsafe mechanisms to prevent costs
