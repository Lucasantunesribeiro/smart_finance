# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completely cleaning and optimizing the SmartFinance project for production deployment. The goal is to remove all unnecessary files, eliminate AWS costs, and ensure the application is 100% ready for production on EC2 with a clean, minimal codebase that contains only essential production files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want all unnecessary development files removed from the project, so that the production deployment contains only essential files and has a clean structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup process is executed THEN all development scripts SHALL be removed from the root directory
2. WHEN documentation cleanup occurs THEN only essential production documentation SHALL remain
3. WHEN backup files are processed THEN all temporary backup directories SHALL be deleted
4. WHEN deployment files are reviewed THEN only the production docker-compose configuration SHALL remain
5. IF any file is not essential for production THEN it SHALL be removed from the project structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious developer, I want all AWS resources analyzed and any billable services eliminated, so that I have zero monthly AWS costs while maintaining full application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS resources are audited THEN all billable services SHALL be identified and terminated
2. WHEN EC2 instances are reviewed THEN only free-tier eligible instances SHALL remain active
3. WHEN storage resources are checked THEN usage SHALL stay within free tier limits
4. WHEN networking resources are analyzed THEN any paid features SHALL be disabled or removed
5. IF any resource generates costs THEN it SHALL be immediately terminated or migrated to free alternatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SmartFinance application fully deployed and operational on EC2, so that it's 100% ready for production use with all services running correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the production deployment is complete THEN all application services SHALL be running and accessible
2. WHEN the frontend is accessed THEN it SHALL load correctly and connect to backend services
3. WHEN the backend API is tested THEN it SHALL respond to all endpoints successfully
4. WHEN the payment microservice is verified THEN it SHALL process transactions correctly
5. WHEN the database is checked THEN it SHALL store and retrieve data properly
6. IF any service fails THEN automated health checks SHALL detect and restart the service

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized Docker configurations for production, so that the application runs efficiently on a single EC2 instance with minimal resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker containers are built THEN they SHALL use multi-stage builds for minimal image sizes
2. WHEN containers are deployed THEN memory limits SHALL be configured to prevent resource exhaustion
3. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL use production-optimized configurations
4. WHEN the application runs THEN total memory usage SHALL not exceed 80% of available EC2 resources
5. IF resource limits are exceeded THEN containers SHALL be automatically restarted with adjusted limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated monitoring and cost protection, so that the system maintains zero costs and high availability without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cost monitoring is active THEN it SHALL check AWS billing every hour
2. WHEN resource usage approaches free tier limits THEN alerts SHALL be triggered immediately
3. WHEN the application is running THEN health checks SHALL verify all services every 5 minutes
4. WHEN any billable resource is detected THEN it SHALL be automatically terminated
5. IF monitoring systems fail THEN failsafe mechanisms SHALL prevent cost accumulation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want the production deployment to follow security best practices, so that the application is protected against common vulnerabilities and attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN all default passwords SHALL be changed to secure values
2. WHEN network access is configured THEN only necessary ports SHALL be exposed
3. WHEN SSL/TLS is implemented THEN all HTTP traffic SHALL be redirected to HTTPS
4. WHEN authentication is active THEN JWT tokens SHALL use secure signing keys
5. WHEN file permissions are set THEN they SHALL follow principle of least privilege
6. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN they SHALL be automatically patched or mitigated
