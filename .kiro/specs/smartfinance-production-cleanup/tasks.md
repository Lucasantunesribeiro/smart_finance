  - Remove unused security groups and key pairs


  - Implement cost monitoring script to check billing every hour
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 3. Create optimized production Docker configuration
  - Update `docker-compose.prod.yml` with memory limits for all services

  - Add Redis container with 64MB memory limit
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_


- [x] 4. Optimize Docker images for production deployment


  - Update Backend Dockerfile with multi-stage build for minimal size
  - Update Frontend Dockerfile with Alpine base and production optimizations
  - Update Payment service Dockerfile with Node.js Alpine image
  - Add health check endpoints to all service containers

  - Configure restart policies for automatic recovery
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_



- [ ] 5. Create production environment configuration
  - Generate secure passwords for all database connections
  - Create production JWT secret key (32+ characters)
  - Configure production environment variables in `.env.production`
  - Update database connection strings for Docker network
  - Configure CORS settings for production domains
  - Set up SSL/TLS configuration for Nginx
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [x] 6. Deploy complete application to EC2 instance


  - Connect to existing EC2 instance (54.146.148.54)
  - Stop any running containers and clean up existing deployment
  - Upload optimized project files to EC2 instance
  - Build and start all containers using production docker-compose
  - Verify all services are running and healthy
  - Test frontend, backend API, and payment service endpoints
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6_



- [ ] 7. Implement automated monitoring and cost protection
  - Create cost monitoring script that checks AWS billing API hourly
  - Set up automated alerts for resource usage approaching free tier limits
  - Configure automatic shutdown mechanism if any costs are detected
  - Implement health check monitoring for all application services
  - Create failsafe script to terminate all resources in emergency



  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 8. Configure security hardening for production
  - Change all default passwords to secure generated values
  - Configure firewall rules to expose only necessary ports (80, 443, 22)
  - Set up SSL certificate for HTTPS (Let's Encrypt or self-signed)
  - Configure JWT authentication with secure signing keys
  - Set proper file permissions on all configuration files
  - Enable security headers in Nginx configuration
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [ ] 9. Perform comprehensive testing and validation
  - Test frontend application loads and functions correctly
  - Verify backend API endpoints respond with correct data
  - Test payment service processes transactions successfully
  - Validate database operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Confirm all services restart automatically after container failure
  - Verify cost monitoring and alerting systems are working
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6_

- [ ] 10. Create production documentation and maintenance procedures
  - Document the final production architecture and service configuration
